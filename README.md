When inside it type python, as soon as you type it the terminal will pop-up some text showing if it is the version 2.7 or 3. If it is 2.7 you should use the version of my script located in the directory src/py2.7 and the same goes instruction goes for the python3 version, which is located at src/py3

#FAQ:

*What if I dont have Python 2 or 3 installed? 

Then you should go to their website(https://www.python.org/) and download one of them or both in order to use this script. Its up to you to decide.

*Which one should I get? Python 2.7 or Python 3? Is there any difference between them?

Well apart from the fact that Python 3 is a major overhaul and severily modified version of its former version(Python 2.7). The fact is that in the present most scripts and older scripts, that their developers have abandoend them and dont update them are mostly written for Python 2.7, so if your focus is on guaranteening compatibility with as many old python software and at the same time using new ones you should get Python 2.7, since it will run almost every script written for it since its release and you will also be able to run most modern scripts for it, since most of them have a version for Py2.7 just like this script I made. However Python 2.7 is becoming obsolete and is no longer updated by its developers. In some years from now Python 3 will become the Open Source Community and Industry Standard and most distributions will already come with it by default. If you wanna know more about the main differences between them I recommend you to read this(https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).
